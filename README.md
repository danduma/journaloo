# ðŸ““ Memoaire

Talk to your memories with Jippy! 

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Import your journal in several formats
    - currently supports DayOne XML and JSON
- Find interesting stuff in your journal!
- Think qualitative rather than quantitative questions for now, like:
  - "What did I do last summer?"
  - "What did I do on my birthday?"
  - "What did I do on my last vacation in France?"
  - "What's my favorite movie?"'
- Relatively private: your journal data is only indexed locally using offline embeddings. However, every query to gpt-4 is sent to OpenAI's API, and it will include relevant sentences / paragraphs from your journal to answer your query
